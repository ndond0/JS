# JS
BHCF.html :
First project using HTML and CSS
I tried to make my own version of a local gym website
Practiced making some of the pages link to the home page, and also practiced using a href links to the actual gym web page

index.html:
Inline JavaScript 
Test your reaction time, interactive game
Was able to get the random color generator to work (copied that code from stackoverflow)
Game is still buggy: first two response times are incorrect and sometimes the images jump when they arenâ€™t supposed to
Still need to organize code better and fix bugs

Survey.html:
Playing around, putting my own inline JavaScript into an HTML file
This little project showed me the importance of working on my CSS organization, the value of comments and the cascading effect of CSS
