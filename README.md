# JS
BHCF.html :
First project using HTML and CSS
I tried to make my own version of a local gym website
Practiced making some of the pages link to the home page, and also practiced using a href links to the actual gym web page

index.html:
Inline JavaScript 
Test your reaction time, interactive game
Was able to get the random color generator to work (copied that code from stackoverflow)
Game is still buggy: first two response times are incorrect and sometimes the images jump when they arenâ€™t supposed to
Still need to organize code better and fix bugs
